  During my university-life. I was fortune enough (Alhamdulliah) to have learnt different JavaScript and Ruby frameworks that existed 
  as termed industry standard which I had very few experience in understanding them as well and its usage. I should specially 
  thank my Lecturer **Mr.Guhanathan Poravi** for his continuous support and guidance. Thanks alot Sir. 

 
## [AngularJS](https://angular.io)

The most famous framework out there in the JS world plus with a very large community support for any issue.
This was taught to me by **Shamal Perera** and **Kripa Jayakumar**. Thanks a lot for your support. The sessions was very good with an interesting 
approachis to build a tiny little social media.

## [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

Following was a challenging one, which was done on building a movie app using react-native. It was good. Plus it clearly
explained how google copied react's features(components) with an MVC approach. my personal opinion
I think react has a **philosophy** not like angular.


## [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com)

Here comes **Dilum**, A very enthusiastic and my type of person cause he likes Opensource just like me. How NodeJS and rest of 
openworld got their package management system with DPKG, Aptitude, and advance Ruby and Git features.

Whole sessions were great and I loved everything. Thanks
